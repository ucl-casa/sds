## Creating an Environment (Staff)

1. Start up the UCL VPN.
2. Connect to [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.data-science.rc.ucl.ac.uk/)
3. Authenticate using UCL credentials.
4. Create a new terminal: File > New > Terminal

## Setting Up the Environment

The ISD instructions are not correct in the sense that the use of a symlink can cause problems and duplicated environments down the line. Anyway, type the following, but note that you need to replace `{replace_this_with_group_name}` with the appropriate group name (this will be obvious once logged in and you can run `ls /shared/groups/`):

```bash
course_name="{{< var module.code >}}"
group_name="{replace_this_with_group_name}"
conda config --add envs_dirs /shared/groups/${group_name}/casa
curl -o /tmp/${course_name}.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jreades/sds_env/master/conda/environment_py.yml
conda env create -p /shared/groups/${group_name}/casa -f /tmp/${course_name}.yml
```

## Tweaks to environyment_py.yml

Two shortcomings in the existing approach of generating `environment_py.yml` were identified and need to be tweaked in the Makefile:

1. Remove anything with `linux` in it 
2. Remove version from gitpython.
3. Remove python-graphviz entirely.

Additional issues may exist with replication to non-Linux systems.

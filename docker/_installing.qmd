## Installing Docker

### Essential Topic

This next section is _essential_ to running the {{< var env.name >}} environment.

:::

Docker is a complex application doing *very* complex things. It's not surprising that it can be a bit of a pain to install. But once installed, it's a very powerful *platform* for 'doing (spatial) data science' that's widely used in industry and, increasingly, academia.

*One* way to think of it as a 'library' of ready-made *virtual* computers that you can copy and use free-of-charge. If you'd like to know more about what Docker is and how it works, you can read more in the [Understanding Docker](../docker/index.qmd#understanding-docker) section.

### Windows Users

Please ensure that you have installed WSL2 *before* installing Docker! If you cannot install WSL2 then please have a look at the 'dealing with errors' section.

*After* you've downloaded Docker, you need to:

1. Install it -- usually this will mean opening the image and either dragging it your Application folder (Mac) or running the installer (Windows)
2. Start it up -- double-click the Docker icon in your Applications folder to start Docker running.
3. Finish setup -- once Docker is finished starting up, you should see the login screen below. You do *not* need to create an account (notice `Continue without signing in`)
4. On all the subsequent questions you can `Skip` (upper-right corner) answering as well.

You **must finish setting up** before proceeding to the next step. You'll know that you're ready to move on when you see the 'Docker Desktop' window appear listing 'downloaded images' and 'running containers':

If you *didn't* see this then you will need to have a look at the '[dealing with errors](#dealing-with-errors)' section.

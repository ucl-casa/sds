# Installing Anaconda Python

**You are strongly encouraged to use the Docker image instead of installing Anaconda Python directly.** The basic reason for this is that you may encounter installation errors or version differences that mean your experience of runing the Spatial Data Science environment is seriously impaired.

If you persist in wanting to install natively, then you should follow the instructions [provided here](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/conda/index.html).

# `sds_env`: Spatial Data Science Platform

We previously experimented with _five_ approaches to installation: [VirtualBox](./virtualbox/README.md); [Vagrant](./vagrant/README.md); [Docker](./docker/README.md); [Podman](https://podman.io/); and [Anaconda Python](./conda/README.md) directly. Each of these has pros and cons, but after careful consideration we have come to the conclusion that Podman/Docker is the most robust way to ensure a consistent experience in which all students end up with the same versions of each library, difficult-to-diagnose hardware/OS issues are minimised, and running/recovery is the most straightfoward.

=========================

For *most* users you should really be looking at this through the [GitHub.io](https://uclcasa.github.io/sds/) web site!
